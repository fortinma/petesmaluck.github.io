The city has a list of names that developers are welcome to use. They've been checked with city staff and the police and fire department to make sure they are appropriate and don't sound too much like an existing street name. Developers can offer their own suggestions, but the name has to survive a scrutinizing process first. Allen worked as a journalist for 41 years, 23 of them with The Spectator.
